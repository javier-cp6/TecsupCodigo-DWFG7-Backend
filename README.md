# Back end for a To-Do List app using Django and MySQL

This project enables users to add individual tasks to a personal list, retrieve them sorted by due date, and mark task progress. Token-based authentication (JWT) provides users with secure access to their personal lists. The app was deployed on Heroku with the JawsDB MySQL add-on.

Besides, the Django's built-in admin site is enabled with a custom user model so staff users have read-only access while admins (superusers) are allowed to edit users and manage their permissions. The Swagger UI is also used to document the REST API.
